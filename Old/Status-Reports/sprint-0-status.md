Sprint-0 is an individual sprint that focus on setting up their environments. All students must complete the sprint
individually. This document is the template for submitting a status report on Sprint-0. 
Completing the report is simply taking screenshots and including them
in the relevant sections of the Markdown document. You will submit a PDF version of the Markdown to GradeScope.
We will post submission instructions on Ed for submitting the report.
